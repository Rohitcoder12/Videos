## üöÄ Setup and Deployment

Follow these steps to get your own instance of the bot running.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   **Telegram Bot Token**: Get a token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.
-   **MongoDB Atlas Account**: Create a free cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and get your database connection string (URI).
-   **Private Source Channel**:
    1.  Create a **private** Telegram channel. This is where you will upload all your videos and photos.
    2.  Add your bot to this channel as an **Administrator**.
    3.  Get the Channel ID. Forward a message from the channel to a bot like `@userinfobot` to get its ID (it will be a negative number, e.g., `-1001234567890`).

### 2. Fork and Clone the Repository

Fork this repository to your own GitHub account and then clone it to your local machine.

### 3. Deployment on Koyeb (Recommended)

This project is optimized for deployment on Koyeb's free tier.

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository**: Push the project files (`bot.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Procfile`) to a new **private** GitHub repository.

2.  **Create a Koyeb App**:
    -   On the Koyeb dashboard, click **"Create App"**.
    -   Connect your GitHub and select the repository for the bot.
    -   **Change Service Type**: In the service configuration, change the type from `Web Service` to **`Worker`**.
    -   **Add Environment Variables**: This is the most critical step. Add the following environment variables with your credentials:
        -   `BOT_TOKEN`: Your token from BotFather.
        -   `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
        -   `DATABASE_NAME`: The name of your database (e.g., `pyasi-bot-db`).
        -   `SOURCE_CHANNEL_ID`: The ID of your private content channel.
        -   `ADMIN_IDS`: A comma-separated list of your numeric Telegram user IDs (e.g., `11111111,22222222`).

3.  **Deploy**: Click **"Deploy"**. Koyeb will automatically build and run your bot. You can monitor the logs from the Koyeb dashboard.
